# GrapherTool
thought that A grapher tool would be great comeback project to python after 2 years

You Need The Functions And Main python files in the same files for the project to work

The Project is quite self explanatory 

it will ask for Max X, Max Y, and Spacing

Max X and Max Y will be multiplied by 2

maxX is how big the X axis is and maxY is how big The Y axis is


it will then ask for linear quadratic or quit

"L" will be for linear
it will ask for rise, run, and y intercept
once the values are given the turtle will produce a line based on the linear equation on the graph that was made previously

Since The Program Is On A Loop It Will Ask For linear quadratic or quit again, if you chose linear again the previous line will be erased and a new one will be created


"Q" will be for quadratic 
it will ask for 3 values(a,b,c) seperated by spaces
the program will produce the zeros or answers to the quadratic equation
The Program Can Also Detect Imaginary Numbers
So Always Check The End Of The 2 or 1 Answers You Are Given For An I
If variable A Is 0 The Program Will Tell You That The Quadratic Equation Is Not Valid
sadly I could not make the program so that you can see the quadratics graph

"q" will be for quit
it will just break the game loop
